# WIP: timecount:
## What:
Mostly a rust rewrite of [termdown](https://github.com/trehn/termdown),
a terminal application that lets the user start, pause, (etc.) timers.

## Why:
~~blazingly fast timers~~
I have found a couple of minor problems with termdown, and I've noticed that
it's last commit was more than a year ago, so I didn't really see a point in
submitting fixes.

Why didn't I fork the project then? Not any particularly good reason. I just
wanted a small rust project to work on in my free time.
